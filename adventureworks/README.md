# Introduction to Adventure Works OLTP DB
AdventureWorks Database is a Microsoft product sample for an online transaction processing (OLTP) database. The AdventureWorks Database supports a fictitious, multinational manufacturing company called Adventure Works Cycles.

## Scenario
Adventure Works Cycles, the fictitious company on which the AdventureWorks sample databases are based, is a large, multinational manufacturing company. The company manufactures and sells metal and composite bicycles to North American, European and Asian commercial markets. While its base operation is located in Bothell, Washington with 290 employees, several regional sales teams are located throughout their market base.

In 2000, Adventure Works Cycles bought a small manufacturing plant, Importadores Neptuno, located in Mexico. Importadores Neptuno manufactures several critical subcomponents for the Adventure Works Cycles product line. These subcomponents are shipped to the Bothell location for final product assembly. In 2001, Importadores Neptuno, became the sole manufacturer and distributor of the touring bicycle product group.

Coming off a successful fiscal year, Adventure Works Cycles is looking to broaden its market share by targeting their sales to their best customers, extending their product availability through an external Web site, and reducing their cost of sales through lower production costs.

Person.Person table. The BusinessEntityID column in the Person.Person table matches the
PersonID column in the Sales.Customer table. Display the CustomerID, StoreID, and TerritoryID
columns along with the name columns.

SalesPerson table. Join the BusinessEntityID column from the Sales.SalesPerson table to the

6. Write a query that displays the names of the customers along with the product names that they
have purchased. Hint - Five tables will be required to write this query! 


## Outer Joins
1. Write a query that displays all the products along with the SalesOrderID even if an order has never
been placed for that product. Join to the Sales.SalesOrderDetail table using the ProductID
column. 

2. Change the query written in question 1 so that only products that have not been ordered show up
in the query. 

3.  Write a query that returns all the rows from the Sales.SalesPerson table joined to the

4. Change the query written in question 3 so that the salespersonâ€™s name also displays from the
Person.Person table.

5.  The Sales.SalesOrderHeader table contains foreign keys to the Sales.CurrencyRate and
Purchasing.ShipMethod tables. Write a query joining all three tables, making sure it contains all
rows from Sales.SalesOrderHeader. Include the CurrencyRateID, AverageRate, SalesOrderID, and
ShipBase columns. 

# Summarizing Data 
Aggregating Data:
1.  Write a query to determine the price of the most expensive product ordered. Use the UnitPrice
column of the Sales.SalesOrderDetail table.

3. Write a query using the Production.Product table that lists a count of the products in each
product line.

that have a count that equals 1. 


# Subqueries

Production.Product table that have been ordered. 

2. Write a query that displays the colors used in the Production.Product table that are not listed in
the Production.ProductColor table using a subquery. Use the keyword DISTINCT before the
column name to return each color only once. 


# Derived Tables and Common Table Expressions
1.  Using a derived table, join the Sales.SalesOrderHeader table to the Sales.SalesOrderDetail table.
Display the SalesOrderID, OrderDate, and ProductID columns in the results. The
Sales.SalesOrderDetail table should be inside the derived table query. 

2. Rewrite the query in question 1 with a common table expression.
